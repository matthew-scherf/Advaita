For Advaita Vedanta sources: The formalization draws primarily on Brahma Sutras with Shankaracharya's commentary, principal Upanishads, and contemporary scholarship by scholars such as Eliot Deutsch, Anantanand Rambachan, and others.

For formal ontology and grounding theory: The formalization connects to contemporary work in analytic metaphysics, particularly theories of ontological dependence and fundamentality.
