## Axiom Dependencies

The formalization exhibits careful dependency structure. Core axioms are independent of other modules. Level axioms depend only on core axioms. Maya, awareness, and Jiva-Isvara axioms build on core and level axioms. Additional axioms require multiple prior modules. This structure ensures that fundamental metaphysical claims are established before more specific doctrines.

## Consistency Considerations

The axiom system does not include contradictory pairs. The absolute-conditioned distinction (A1b) prevents category confusion. Uniqueness axioms (A2, A3) ensure that Brahman and Atman refer to single entities. Level axioms prevent entities from existing at multiple levels simultaneously. The formalization maintains logical consistency throughout, as verified by Lean 4's type checker.
