# Documentation Index

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Advaita Vedanta formalization.

## Core Documentation

AXIOMS.md: Complete listing of all 114 axioms organized by module, with formal statements and philosophical interpretations. Consult this document to understand the foundational principles of the formalization.

THEOREMS.md: Catalog of 40+ proven theorems including the master theorem (Tat Tvam Asi). Each theorem includes formal statement, proof strategy, and philosophical significance.

METHODOLOGY.md: Detailed explanation of the formalization approach, including translation strategy, design decisions, verification process, and philosophical interpretation. Essential reading for understanding how traditional doctrine was converted to formal logic.

## Navigation Guide

For newcomers to the formalization: Begin with the main README.md, then consult METHODOLOGY.md to understand the approach, followed by AXIOMS.md to see the foundational principles.

For researchers investigating specific doctrines: Use AXIOMS.md to locate relevant axiom groups, then check THEOREMS.md for proven consequences.

For formal verification specialists: METHODOLOGY.md explains design decisions and verification approach. The source code files in the AdvaitaVedanta directory contain the actual Lean 4 implementations.

For philosophers of Indian philosophy: THEOREMS.md provides the most philosophically significant results with detailed interpretations. METHODOLOGY.md addresses questions of textual fidelity and translation.

For comparative philosophy: METHODOLOGY.md discusses how the formalization relates to other systems and identifies potential points of comparison.

## File Relationships

The documentation files form a logical progression:

1. README.md provides overview and motivation
2. METHODOLOGY.md explains the formalization approach
3. AXIOMS.md presents the foundational principles
4. THEOREMS.md shows what can be proven from those principles
5. CONTRIBUTING.md explains how to extend the work

## Technical References

For Lean 4 syntax and features: Consult the official Lean documentation at https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/

For Advaita Vedanta sources: The formalization draws primarily on Brahma Sutras with Shankaracharya's commentary, principal Upanishads, and contemporary scholarship by scholars such as Eliot Deutsch, Anantanand Rambachan, and others.

For formal ontology and grounding theory: The formalization connects to contemporary work in analytic metaphysics, particularly theories of ontological dependence and fundamentality.

## Updates

This documentation reflects formalization version 4.5.0. Significant changes to axioms or theorems will be documented in CHANGELOG.md (when available) and reflected in updated documentation files.
